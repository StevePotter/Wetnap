Does seeing !string.IsNullOrEmpty and "if (foo.IndexOf(bar)…" all over your code base make you sick to your stomach?  Then, you're in luck!

Wetnap is a lightweight of .net extension methods that make coding, especially with strings, a bit easier.  It has all kinds of cool nuggets for testing, splitting, and combining strings.  Some highlights:

   * !string.IsNullOrEmpty(foo) becomes simply foo.HasChars()

   * "www.google.com".After("www.") is "google.com"
   * "ate hot dogs".StartWith("hate") is "hate hot dogs"
   * "*feature".Surround("**") is "**feature**"
   * "aaabaa".StartWithout("a") is "baa"

And it goes on.  Wetnap is a simple drop-in library, available as a nuget package.  Include it in your project and you are set…no namespaces to import and Wetnap won't interfere with existing stuff.

Open source and fully tested, Wetnap makes .net even better.
